      <h2 id="what-it-is">What It Is</h2>
      <p>
        A day planner app that uses gamification to translate your long-term
        goals into manageable, short-term to-dos.

      <h2 id="how-it-works">How the App Works</h2>
      <p>
        We are still refining the UI and will more to share in a couple of
        weeks, but we‚Äôve got the main stuff down:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Start by writing down your principles & goals.</strong> A
          pretty basic concept, but we‚Äôve found that most people don‚Äôt do it. We
          believe this is because no one asks about your principles & goals.
          It‚Äôs just not table-talk material the way <em>Game of Thrones</em> is
          - although we think it should be (more on that in a moment). The
          process of writing down your principles & goals does something magical
          - it forces you to <em>define</em> them. Writing is refined thinking,
          after all.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <strong>Then, start walking the walk.</strong> The best way to get
          anywhere is by moving in that direction. Goals work the same way - the
          best way to achieve them is to start working towards them. We believe
          it‚Äôs best to do this every day, with your principles as your guide.
          We're building a tool that helps you do just that. From planning, to
          action, to reflection, this quick daily routine is like a gym for your
          life.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <strong>Assemble your squad, your posse, your Ride or Dies.</strong>{' '}
          Everything is better together. üëØ‚Äç We believe no one achieves their
          goals on their own. We want to build a new kind of social network that
          supports your ambitions, holds you accountable for your goals, and
          infuses real life into every conversation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="mission">Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Our mission is to help people live richer lives by enabling them to
        protect their most valuable resources - time, energy, and attention.
      </p>
      <h2 id="insight">Insight</h2>
      <p>
        We've just arrived at the most important crossroad in human history. The
        direction we go next will determine the length and quality of the future
        of our species.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the first ~95% of human history, we were hunter-gatherers and spent
        most of our time trying to satisfy basic needs like food, shelter, and
        safety. In other words, <em>we were in survival mode.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        12,000 years ago, we settled down with our new farms and started to get
        jobs. This allowed us to trade our labor for food and such, but we were
        definitely still in survival mode. And we stayed that way until very
        recently.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Digital Revolution has given us lots of cool stuff like computers
        and the internet, but the most valuable thing it has has given us is
        more time. In some cases, tasks that took days now take seconds and we
        are left with more hours in the day and more days in our life. We‚Äôve
        finally make it out of survival mode, and just in the last 0.3% of our
        history. How awesome is it that you are here to see it?
      </p>
      <p>So where do we go from here? Well, we have 2 options.</p>
      <p>
        We can take our newly liberated hours and lose ourselves in an endless
        scroll or a Netflix binge. We can let ourselves be distracted by
        short-term dopamine hits and let our egos steer the ship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or we can put these hours working towards something better and redefine
        what the future can be. But first, we have to decided and it starts with
        you.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What are you doing today?</em>
      </p>
      <h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>
      <p>
        We were inspired to start working on this project after spending too
        many years reading self-improvements books, studying our idols, and
        seeking life advice from other people instead of living our life. We
        realized that a lot stuff we learned was recycled from somewhere else -
        same cake, different icing. We started to ask ourselves if was possible
        to systematize all of this advice. We wondered{' '}
        <em>what if you could you just download a better life experience</em>?
        How many years wiser would we be had been ‚Äúan app for that‚Äù when we were
        young? It was too late for us, we‚Äôd put in the time. But it wasn‚Äôt too
        late for our little brothers, so we decided to give it a shot.
      </p>
      <p>Of all the things we read, these inspired us the most: </p>
